        <p>My name is Sai Snehitha Bhatta.
            I'm currently pursuing my Post Graduation in Mobile Application Design and Development at Lambton College.<br>
            I graduated from JNTUH in the stream of Electronics in the year 2018. As a non-IT background, I have a passion for programming.
            I did courses on Java, HTML and, Oracle.
            After that, I got hired as a Java Intern in VBS, and later on, they hired me for a full-time Software Engineer. I got groomed in Java, Spring Boot, web services, Oracle, and Angular.
            I worked on two projects in a team of 12.
            Responsible for creating and designing both front and back end design as per the components.
            Analyze the requirement and understand the function-related design.
            I helped the supporting team members with the queries in the backend.
            It was a great experience. I learned a lot working as a software engineer for 2years.
            I have a good knowledge of object oriented programming (oops) and associated technologies.
            I'm excited about this opportunity and, the overall job description is a good match for me</p>
