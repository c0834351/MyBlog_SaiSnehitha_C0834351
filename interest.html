            <dd>I love badminton because it’s an indoor sport so you can play it regardless of the weather.
                Also, the entry-level is low, so you can bring friends that have never played it, and you will get a fun time from it.
                Socializing with friends is great in badminton. Also, it’s a good workout and cheap!

            <dd>It is very convenient and can save us much time.
                In addition, we can get the news of current events instantly on the Internet.
                We can also choose what we want to know on the Web.
                We can not only save time in searching news but also save the money for buying newspapers.

            <dd>Swimming builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness.
                It helps you maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs.
                It tones muscles and builds strength.
                It provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming.

            <img src="images/iceskating.jpeg" alt="Ice skating image" width="250" height="250">
            <dd>Learning to ice skate is hard but it is not impossible for an average person.
                Balancing is what people find very hard in ice skating because of the thin blades.
                It is very hard in the beginning but after a few weeks of practice and after learning to balance, it becomes pretty easy and you pick up the speed.
